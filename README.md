## 🧠 Project Description

This project was developed as part of the **Object Oriented Programming** course.  
It focuses on building a **Blood Bank Management System** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Java **AWT & Swing**.  

The system provides the following functionalities:
- Add, update, and manage donor information  
- Store and track blood group details  
- Search and retrieve donor records efficiently  
- Tabular display of data using `JTable`  
- Event-driven interaction with GUI components

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java  
- **GUI Libraries:** AWT, Swing  
- **Concepts Implemented:**
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
  - Event Handling  
  - GUI Layouts (FlowLayout, GridLayout, BorderLayout)  
  - JTable, JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, JTextField
